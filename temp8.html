        <p class="line">“Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Way” was the title of a 1981 biography of Ted Turner, who
            also
            had the saying on a plaque on his desk.</p>

        <p>In life there are leaders or at times it is you who must take the role of leader. Another option in life
            is
            to follow the leader. Nothing is wrong with being a follower, and if this is your role in a situation,
            being
            a good follower is just as important as being the leader. And finally, there are leaders and followers
            as
            well as those who just seem to get in the way. People who get in the way choose not to lead or to follow
            but
            slow the progress of an individual or group that is striving towards a goal. This quote has helped me in
            life and business.</p>
